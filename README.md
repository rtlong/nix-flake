# my nix flake

This is my [Nix](https://nixos.org/) flake where I intend to manage all my Linux and Mac systems. It uses [Snowfallorg/lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib) to organize different responsibilities and provide structure.

## Acknowledgement

I took heavy inspiration (or outright copied a bunch) from [khaneliman/khanelinix](https://github.com/khaneliman/khanelinix), though the git history may not make that clear.
